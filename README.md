TICTACTOE MAX !

Project Description: For our project, we decided to create a TicTacToe game called, TicTacToe Max, a grid game with a bit of added features to make the original slightly more interesting. Our project contained a mix of HTML (website) and JavaScript files (server). Differences in our game compared to the original was the rule of 3 in a row which we changed to 5, in order to add a bit of difficulty and challenge to the game. Another added feature to our game was the ability for players to take spots on the grid which resulted in much longer and competitive games. We started the project by designing a website that gave a chance for users to learn the new rules of our game as well as hyperlinks to other functions of our project (leaderboard, rules, etc). We wanted users to interact with one another while playing and decided to create a chatbox embedded in the game which gave users a multiplayer experience. On top of that, we included a leaderboard to give again, a competitive platform amongst players. Ultimately, our project provides a different approach to a classic game but we felt that our added features gave users a unique experience in playing our project; TicTacToe Max.
